# SQL--MySQL-for-Data-Analytics-and-Business-Intelligence
Online SQL course for Business Intelligence

# How important is database management in the age of big data and analytics?

It is pretty important.

# How many employers would be happy to hire employees who can use data for the purposes of business intelligence?

All of them.

# How many people have these skills?

Not enough.

This is why now is the right time to learn SQL and acquire a competitive advantage in the work marketplace. Remember, the average salary of a SQL developer is $92,000! That’s a lucrative career.

How come?

Well, when you can work with SQL, it means you don’t have to rely on others sending you data and executing queries for you. You can do that on your own. This allows you to be independent and dig deeper into the data to obtain the answers to questions that might improve the way your company does its business. Database management is the foundation for data analysis and intelligent decision making relying on numbers.

Worried that you have no previous experience?

Not an issue. We will start from the very basics and will gradually teach you everything you need to know. Step by step. With no steps skipped.
